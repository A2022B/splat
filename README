This is the Analysis Toolkit for the SpeX Prism Library, 
currently under development at UCSD.  These routines (will) 
allow the user to read, visualize, analyze and fit SpeX prism 
data of ultracool dwarfs contained in the Library and compare 
to user supplied data.  This is obviously still in development.
