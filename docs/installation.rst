Installation and Dependencies
===============================================

SPLAT is best forked from the github site http://github.org/aburgasser/splat, 
which is updated on a regular basis.
SPLAT has not yet reached v1.0, so bugs are common. Please help us squish them by 
sending bug reports to aburgasser@ucsd.edu 

Instructions on setting up and using SPLAT are maintained at http://www.browndwarfs.org/splat

You should copy the file ``.splat_access`` into your home directory - this is your access key
if you have priveleged access to unpublished data.
